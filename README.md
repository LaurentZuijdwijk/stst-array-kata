## 00 _ Before you start

Before you start these sessions consider the project structure.

### Installation 

Make sure you have the latests NodeJS version installed. We won't be using any external libraries.

### Project structure

- The `README.md` explains the basics of the project.
- The `.gitignore` is tailored to generic Python projects.
- The `.vscode` folder contains:
  - A `launch.json` file defining how to run the project.
  - A `tasks.json` file that ensures `pip` is run before
    debug to install all package dependencies.
- The `src` folder is where all code is.
  - There, the `src/main.py` is the entry point to the code.
  - And the `src/requirements.txt` is the file definining
    the package dependencies of the project.
