## 00 _ Before you start

Before you start these sessions consider the project structure.

### Installation 

Make sure you have the latests NodeJS version installed. We won't be using any external libraries.

### Project structure

- The `README.md` explains the basics of the project.
- The `src` folder is where all code is.
  
The exercises are numbered. Each file contains text describing the exercise and some code. 
The file will contain assertions which should pass when running the file. 

For example: 
run `node ./src/01-getting-started.js`
The terminal will output an error. 
Follow the instructions and add code to make the assertions pass
run `node ./src/01-getting-started.js`
No error will be displayed.
