# Javascript Kata

_Advanced javascript and NodeJS._

### Before you start

Before you start these sessions make sure you read this document.

### Installation 

Have at least Node.js version 14 installed. There iis no need for any external libraries. Just a text editor and command line is all you need.

We would recommend using VSCode with an embedded terminal. Turn off any AI code helpers.

### Project structure

- The `README.md` explains the basics of the project.
- The `src` folder is where the consecutive steps are outlined.
  
The exercises are numbered. Each file contains some background information, a block of source code, assertions and exercises. 
The assertions will only pass when the exercises are completed. 

For example: 
run `node ./src/01-getting-started.js`
The terminal will output an error. 
Follow the instructions and add code to make the assertions pass
run `node ./src/01-getting-started.js`
No error will be displayed.

Assertions use the Node.js assertion modules.
